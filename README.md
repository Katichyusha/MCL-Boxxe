# CONTROLS
--------
Mouse/cursor movement pushes player box
Escape exits game during gameplay


The controls of the game function in a way that the direction in which you move your mouse will be the direction the box will move.
The box moves at a rate directly corresponding to the speed and amount of mouse movement with a soft cap so it cannot be abused.

All features, levels and assets are subject to change.
